Tools and technology used
--------------------------

- jQuery Mobile (with 'flat-ui' theme)
- PhonegGap
- BackboneJS
- RequireJS


To start developing
--------------------

*Note:* You can develop without Phonegap, and just work on it as if it was a normal web-app.

1. Checkout this github repo.
2. The main app is `app/www/index.html` 
3. To open `index.html` you need to run it on a localhost. 
    - Use `xampp` and put the whole folder into `htdocs`
    - *or* open command line inside the `app/www` folder and run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` then check localhost:8000 *requires Python*


Running as a Phonegap app
-------------------

- Install PhoneGap: http://phonegap.com/install/
- Download Phonegap Developer App: http://app.phonegap.com/
- Then from the app folder run `phonegap serve`
